# Deck of Cards

## Overview
This project is a simple React application that allows users to interact with a deck of playing cards using the [Deck of Cards API](http://deckofcardsapi.com/). Users can draw cards from a deck, view the drawn cards, and shuffle the deck to start over.

## Features
- **Draw a Card**: Users can draw a single card at a time from the deck. Each drawn card is displayed on the screen.
- **Shuffle Deck**: Users can shuffle the deck at any time to reset and start drawing from a new, full deck.
- **Error Handling**: The app alerts the user when there are no more cards left to draw.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Axios**: For making API requests to the Deck of Cards API.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
